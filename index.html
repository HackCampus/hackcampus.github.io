        <h3>Gain experience you can't get at university</h3>
<p>While university is great for teaching you the theory, university assignments won't teach you the essential skills you need to become a 10x software engineer. Nothing will prepare you better for your career than real work experience.</p>
<h3>Live TODO</h3>
<p>You will get a room in accommodation in Central London TODO</p>
<h3>Real software engineering work on real projects</h3>
<p>In many cases, our interns have deployed production-ready code in their first week, sometimes even on their first day!</p>

        <h2>Startups</h2>
<p><strong>Small companies find it difficult to devote time to hiring interns - we reduce the amount of work companies have to do by extensively vetting applicants, and making sure that their technical abilities match the requirements of your company.</strong></p>
<h3>Develop leadership skills in your tech team</h3>
<p>Being an effective tech lead and mentor can only be learned with hands-on experience. Taking on interns is a highly effective and low-risk way to develop essential mentoring and leadership skills in your tech team.</p>
<h3>Prototype new ideas &amp; tools for your business</h3>
<p>Every tech team has projects that would be &quot;nice to have&quot;, but don't have the resources to complete. Interns are a perfect choice for implementing prototypes of such projects, such as internal tools, or adding features to existing products.</p>
<h3>Raise your company's profile among the most talented students</h3>
<p>Many of the students that have taken part in the programme are heavily involved in student societies, and participate in dozens of student hackathons across the country. Make sure your company gets mentioned when students discuss careers.</p>
